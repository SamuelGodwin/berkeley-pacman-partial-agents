84 ---had a very high win rate of winning 80/90%+ of the time
The files that I wrote in exclusively is [mdpAgents.py]; the rest of the materials are from Berkeley's Cs188x AI course (so I claim no credit for them) and Simon Parsons.

Python ver 2.7.

To run, download the files and move to the directory where the base files are in, and run python pacman.py -p PartialAgent -l mediumClassic, where mediumClassic is the map Pacman's playing on.

C:\Python27\python pacman.py -p PartialAgent -l mediumClassic

Run with flag ... to get an idea of overall win rates

This, CW2 of this module and one other module (pretty sure it was iai) had the yowza that's a lot of files limit when uploading via upload (too many files in the test_cases folder so couldn't include that folder). If this were done via git command line push, it would upload without the limit no problem!
